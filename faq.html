                        <p>Q: What were your biggest inspirations to the game?</p>
                        <p>A: We were really inspired by RPGs such as OneShot and Undertale. We were also heavily inspired by story games such as games made by Quantic Dream.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Q: When is the game going to be released?</p>
                        <p>A: We do not have an exact date for when the game is going to be released. We might update the website with information regarding the release of the game though so do keep a look out!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Q: Where will the game be playable?</p>
                        <p>A: We want to start off by making the game playable on PC first and ensuring it's stable. We <span style="color: red;">ARE</span> planning to try and make the game compatible with other devices and consoles so don't worry! Not all hope is lost!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Q: Have you guys made any other games?</p>
                        <p>A: Sadly no. We are a new team of developers and Recall is going to be our first game project. We are however planning to release more games in the future after Recall though!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Q: Can I contact you?</p>
