                        <p>A: We were really inspired by RPGs such as OneShot and Undertale. We were also heavily inspired by story games such as games made by Quantic Dream.</p>

                        <p>A: We want to start off by making the game playable on PC first and ensuring it's stable. We <span style="color: red;">ARE</span> planning to try and make the game compatible with other devices and consoles so don't worry! Not all hope is lost!</p>

                        <p>A: Sadly no. We are a new team of developers and Recall is going to be our first game project. We are however planning to release more games in the future after Recall though!</p>
