# Recall

GitHub Link: https://yeamchoonyong.github.io/Recall/

This project is about a website that is used to promote and preview a game that has not been released yet. However, there is also a twist to this website. The website also has many different secrets that are to be found. These secrets would give the users achievements which will then be displayed on their accounts. The goal of this project was to make a website that utilizes unique interactivity while also including a gamification system. The name of this project would be named Recall, which is the name of the game.

## Design Process

During the first few days of the project, the original idea was to actually make a game using JavaScript commands. It was supposed to be a first-person point & click story-based game where your goal is to escape a laboratory. However, after some attempts at trying to code the game, there were many issues that our group ran into such as trying to code all of the functions from scratch. After some brainstorming of a new idea, we decided to take a page out of Game Developer Scott Cawthon's book. 

It was at that moment that we decided to create a website that is used to promote the same game that we were trying to code while also having secrets that are linked to the game's lore.

During the first few days of the new project, we decided to first come up with some user stories for the project. This will give us a better idea of what the website should look like and how it will appeal to the different users.

Some examples of our user stories include:

- As a fan of websites that use interactive media, I want to see a website that has interesting dynamic media such as videos
- As a huge follower of video games, I want an informative website that has a method of contact between the fans and the developers
- As a extreme fan of video games, I want a website that is able to inform me clearly about the upcoming features of a game currently in development
- As a fan of cute designs in Indie Games, I want to see a 2D character that I can feel more attached to them.
- As a keen RPG story games player, I want an interactive adventure story with a good pace that keeps me engaged.

Some of the examples listed were mainly made with the game in mind. However, we felt that it also applied to the website as well with the secrets and designs.

## Features

For our features of the website, we decided to think about the main website's functionalities first. The first thing that came to mind is an about page. This page is used to help preview the game, so it will mainly contain content that the game is going to have when it comes out. On this page, we decided that this would be where we place our 3D models. Originally, we were going to make the 3D models an interactable in the game, but we have now decided to use the models inside of the about page as a showcase instead. We have also decided to put in some of the backgrounds of the game.

We also decided to include an FAQ page that will answer questions that people have about the game that are frequently asked.

The next few features are the more interesting ones as they revolve around the game system we have. We decided to make an account page that will allow the users to view their stats on the website. The stats come in the form of achievements, which the users can obtain from doing actions on the website. These actions include many different secrets. The features for these secrets include invisible text across the webpages that has the same color as the background which can only be highlighted by clicking and dragging. There are also secret pages that the user can also access by following the hints to discover the pages.

There are also other pages such as an OST page which the players can unlock by entering a code on the first page, which will allow the player to listen to the game's soundtrack. 

### Existing Features

- Home page - Allows the user to see what the website is about while also having a contact page to send messages to the developers.
- About page - Allows the user to see the upcoming previews for the game.
- OST Page - Starts off locked until a code is entered, which will allow the user to play the music from the game's OST.
- Account Page - Used to show the player's gained achievements.
- FAQ Page - A page with answers to questions that users frequently ask.
- Logs Page - Starts off inaccessible, but it will contain the mysterious logs that can be found by following the game's secrets.
- Invisible Text - Scattered across the website, can be found by clicking and dragging over them. Used to find the secrets.
- Achievements - Earned by finding specific secrets.

### Features Left to Implement
- We also are considering to make a counter that will count the number of players who get the final secret. This is used to check who are the first 50 people who got the final secret. These people will then get a special reward regarding the release of the game.

## Technologies Used

We used HTML for the main content of the page. This was also how we also implemented the 3D models and the designs into the website.

We used CSS to make the website look better by changing the color scheme of the website. We also used the CSS to make the website more responsive.

JavaScript was the main key to making the website interactive. By creating different JavaScript commands, we can create interesting interactions that will engage the users more.

We used an API that allows the user to log in to their accounts by getting data from a database.

The project also uses jQuery to help simplify the DOM manipulation.

## Credits

### Content
- Since this website is for a fictional game, all of the information was made by us.

### Acknowledgements

- The idea for making the secrets on game infographic website were inspired by Game Developer Scott Cawthon and the Five Night's At Freddy's (FNAF) Franchise.
- The mechanics for searching the website for clues were inspired by games made by Reflect Studios, especially Welcome To The Game.
- The acheivement system was inspired by video games in general, but it also takes inspiration from game websites and apps such as Steam or Newgrounds.
